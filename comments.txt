frames.svg is not correct. The colors of the frames are wrong, and it also appears that some of the transformations are not correct (although it is a bit hard to tell because the file does not match the color scheme).

But, all points should be at the same location in the svg (you are expressing them in different coordinates, but ultimately they refer to the same geometric object).

nusim missing dependency on turtlelib in package.xml, this leads to failed compilation (non-deterministically, due to variability in parallel compilation order)
